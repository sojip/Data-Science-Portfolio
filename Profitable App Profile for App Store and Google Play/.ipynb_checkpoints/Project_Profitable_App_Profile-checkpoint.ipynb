    "Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. Our job is to enable a team of developers to make data-driven decisions while they only build apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app. \n",

Collecting data for over four million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we’ll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:\n",

One way to go about this is to remove each app whose name contains a symbol that is not commonly used in English text — English text usually includes letters from the English alphabet, numbers composed of digits from 0 to 9, punctuation marks (., !, ?, ;, etc.), and other symbols (+, *, /, etc.). All these characters that are specific to English texts are encoded using the ASCII standard. Each ASCII character has a corresponding number between 0 and 127 associated with it, and we can take advantage of that to build a function that checks an app name and tells us whether it contains non-ASCII characters. We built this function below, and we use the built-in ord() function to find out the corresponding encoding number of each character.To minimize the impact of data loss, we’ll only remove an app if its name has more than three non-ASCII characters:"

    "We can see that among the free English apps, more than a half (58.16%) are games. Entertainment apps are close to 8%, followed by photo and video apps, which are close to 5%. Only 3.66% of the apps are designed for education, followed by social networking apps which amount for 3.29% of the apps in our data set. The general impression is that App Store (at least the part containing free English apps) is dominated by apps that are designed for fun (games, entertainment, photo and video, social networking, sports, music, etc.), while apps with practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle, etc.) are more rare. However, the fact that fun apps are the most numerous doesn’t also imply that they also have the greatest number of users — the demand might not be the same as the offer. Let’s continue by examining the Genres and Category columns of the Google Play data set (two columns which seem to be related)."

    "However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing a team of developer could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where they could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, they could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don’t need to exit the app to look up words in an external app. This idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store. Other genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea we described above, but the other genres don’t seem too interesting to us:"

However, we don’t need very precise data for our purposes — we only want to get an idea which app genres attract the most users, and we don’t need perfect precision with respect to the number of users. We’re going to leave the numbers as they are, which means that we’ll consider that an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, and an app with 1,000,000+ installs has 1,000,000 installs, and so on. To perform computations, however, we’ll need to convert each install number to float — this means that we need to remove the commas and the plus characters, otherwise the conversion will fail and raise an error. We’ll do this directly in the loop below, where we also compute the average number of installs for each genre (category)."

    "We see the same pattern for the video players category, which is the runner-up with 24,727,872 installs. The market is dominated by apps like Youtube, Google Play Movies & TV, and MX Player. The pattern is repeated for social apps (where we have giants like Facebook, Instagram, Google+, etc.), photography apps (Google Photos and other popular photo editors), or productivity apps (Microsoft Word, Dropbox, Google Calendar, Evernote, etc.). Again, the main concern is that these app genres might seem more popular than they really are. Moreover, these niches seem to be dominated by a few giants who are hard to compete against. The game genre seems pretty popular, but previously we found out this part of the market seems a bit saturated, so we’d like to come up with a different app recommendation if possible. The books and reference genre looks fairly popular as well, with an average number of installs of 8,767,811. It’s interesting to explore this in more depth, since we found this genre has some potential to work well on the App Store, and our aim is to recommend an app genre that shows potential for being profitable on both the App Store and Google Play. Let’s take a look at some of the apps from this genre and their number of installs:"

    "This niche seems to be dominated by software for processing and reading ebooks, as well as various collections of libraries and dictionaries, so it’s probably not a good idea to build similar apps since there’ll be some significant competition. We also notice there are quite a few apps built around the book Quran, which suggests that building an app around a popular book can be profitable. It seems that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. However, it looks like the market is already full of libraries, so developers need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc."
